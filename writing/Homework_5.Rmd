Goal is to create a map showing the locations of homicides in Atlanta, GA. Use sf and tigris to download boundaries for the sub city geography (tracts, block groups, county subdivisions) to show as a layer underneath the points showing homicides. Differentiate solved and unsolved homicides using facets and show the three race groups with the highest number of homicides for the city. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(forcats)
homicide <- read.csv("~/Work/Fall 2023/R for Research/Homework_5/data/homicide-data.csv")
